"""
This script should be run after having generated new screenshot images
with `BabylonStudio -a`
It will proocess all images inside assets/screenshots/ScreenshotsData/
and compare them with the previous git version.

Only the images with significant differences will be kept with their new version.
The other ones will be replaced by the previous version.

This helps creating commits that contain only the relevant screenshot modifications.

How to run it:

- First make sure to use python >= 3.6
- Install the required modules:
> pip3 install opencv-python scikit-image imutils
- Run it:
From the main repo folder, run

> python3 codegeneration/compare_screenshots_git.py
